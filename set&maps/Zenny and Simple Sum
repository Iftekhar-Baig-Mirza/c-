Zenny read about

�
�
�
Array and now she is cracking Array’s questions. She told about this to his friend 
�
�
�
Zen .
�
�
�
Zen wants to check how much 
�
�
�
�
�
Zenny know about Array .So, he has given her an array of integers of size 
�
N . 
�
�
�
�
�
’
�
Zenny’s task is to find out the sum of all distinct positive integer and distinct negative integers in the given array . As 
�
�
�
�
�
Zenny is beginner in problem solving so she is looking for your help.

Input:
First line will contain 
�
T, the number of testcases.
Each testcase contains of two lines first line contains 
�
N size of array and
the second line contains N space-separated integers.
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line containing S1 and S2 where S1 and S2 are sum of distinct positive integers and sum of distinct negative integers respectively. Sum will not be greater than 10^9 and will not be less than -10^9.

4 5 3 3 -1 -2

Sample Output:
1 -3

12 -3

EXPLANATION:
Case 1:- Distinct positive integers are 1,0 and distinct negative integers are -1,-2
sum of positive integers S1 is 1+0=1 and sum of negative integers S2 is (-1+(-2))=-3.
So, output is 1 -3.

Case 2:- Distinct positive integers are 4,5,3 and distinct negative integers are -1,-2
sum of positive integers S1 is 4+5+3=12 and sum of negative integers S2 is (-1+
(-2))=-3.So, output is 12 -3.

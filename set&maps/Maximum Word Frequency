Term frequency–Inverse document frequency (tf-idf) is a numerical statistic which reflects the importance of words in a document collection. It is often used in information retrieval system. The number of times a word appears in the document (word frequency) is one of the major factors to acquire tf-idf.

You are asked to write a program to find the most frequent word in a document.

Input
The first line contains an integer 
�
 
(
1
≤
�
≤
1000
)
n (1≤n≤1000) which determines the number of words. The following 
�
n lines include the list of words, one word per line. A word contains only lower-case letters and it can contain up to 
20
20 characters.

Output
Print the word that has the highest frequency and its frequency, separated by a single space. If you get two or more results, choose one that comes later in the lexicographical order.


code for the above problem


#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int n,i,max=0;
   cin>>n;
   string str;
   map<string,int>mp;
   for(i=0;i<n;i++){
       cin>>str;
       mp[str]++;
   }
   for(auto p:mp){
       if(p.second>=max){
           max=p.second;
           str=p.first;
       }
   }
   cout<<str<<" "<<max;
//my code
}

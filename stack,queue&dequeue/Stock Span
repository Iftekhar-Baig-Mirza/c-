You are given a series of daily price quotes for a stock and you need to calculate span of stock’s price for each day. The span Si of the stock’s price on current day i is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days just before the current day[including the current day], on which the price of the stock is less than or equal to its price on the current day.

Input Format

First line of input contains T - number of test cases. Its followed by 2T lines, the first line contains N - the size of the array. The second line contains N integers - the elements of the array, ith element denotes the stock price on ith day.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 200
1 <= N <= 104
0 <= A[i] <= 104

Output Format

For each test case, print space-separated Stock Span Array, separated by new line.

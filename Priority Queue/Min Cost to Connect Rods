You are given the lengths of N rods. You want to connect all the rods to form a single rod. The cost of connecting 2 rods of lengths: L1 and L2 is L1+L2. The resultant rod will also be of size L1+L2. Your task is to find the minimum cost to connect all the rods.

Input Format

First line of input contains T - number of test cases. Its followed by 2T lines, first line of each test case contains N - the number of rods. The next line contains N integers - the lengths of the rods.

Constraints

30 points
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= L[i] <= 1000

70 points
1 <= T <= 500
1 <= N <= 10000
1 <= L[i] <= 1000

Output Format

For each test case, print the minimum cost to connect all the rods, separated by newline.
